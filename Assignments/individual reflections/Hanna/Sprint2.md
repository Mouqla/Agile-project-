1. I realized this week that Javascript isn’t so self-explaining if you haven’t worked with it before. So I have put a lot of time trying to understand that together with the code we have so far in our project. I would like to implement and contribute to some more user stories in the next sprints. 
2. I think that our team isn’t really working as a group.. we’re having problem communicating. I’m trying to be at front and deliver notes from meetings and mention important things in our chat but at the same time, I don’t feel that I can hunt people to be attending to our meetings. 
It also feels like our team mostly focuses on our actual product instead of everything around with the agile process. I would like to bring in the agile term ”retrospectives” into our team because I think that would help us get to know how we want to work together in a better way. We kind of discuss it on our meetings in the end of the sprints already, but everyone is not really saying anything there. Therefore I think it could be a good way for everyone to raise their voice.
3. I have been working by myself with the code this week. On the planning meeting on Monday, we planned to work on some user stories together but I feel that I have a bit of a problem working together because I feel that I don’t really understand what’s happening. But I also know this isn’t a proper reason because you often learn the most by working together and helping each other.
