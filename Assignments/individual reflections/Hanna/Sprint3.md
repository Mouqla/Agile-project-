1. I’m a little curious about what’s happening in a real agile team if someone in the team gets sick or for some reason can’t attend and work in a sprint. Otherwise I haven’t that much to mention here this week.
2. I have been sick with fever and very down all week so haven’t been able to contribute to the team’s deliveries, more than attending to the discord-meetings. Next sprint I count on being back to contribute to the project, both in code and for our agile work in the team.
3. This week hasn’t included any changes for me, but for the team I can see some progress of what I mentioned last week. I can see the group is working better together due to some changes we implemented in our way of working.
