1. I am excited about learning how to make a heatmap, or other tech challenges. I look forward to learning more about frontend development generally. It would be interesting to learn something about testing for frontend. Iâ€™d like to develop myself to be a better teammate too.
2. This sprint I feel that I have been active, working both on prototyping, defining User Stories, communicating with the team and developing. I feel like I have communicated a lot, but that I could communicate perhaps more effectively. Sometimes I get over excited and do a bit too much, and I should make space for others.
