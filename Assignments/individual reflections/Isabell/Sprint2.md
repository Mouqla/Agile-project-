This week I feel that I have continued to challenge myself with doing frontend programming and using APIs, and deepened my knowledge in these areas. I took on a task that involved some new challenges and it went well.

I contributed to the team's deliveries by completing two user stories that we had marked as 'must have's'. I helped with creating and prioritizing stories for this week. I also got us access to, and implemented, a new API which will give us better and more consistent data.

I feel good about the work that I do, that it is interesting, and that I am learning a lot. 
But I feel a bit frustrated about working remote, and never meeting in person, and feel that it is making it harder to communicate and work together, especially as we don't know each other.
