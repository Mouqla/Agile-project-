This week I feel that I have continued to challenge myself with doing frontend programming and using APIs, and deepened my knowledge in these areas. I took on a task that involved some new challenges and it went well.

I contributed to the team's deliveries by completing two user stories that we had marked as 'must have's'. I helped with creating and prioritizing stories for this week. I also got us access to, and implemented, a new API which will give us better and more consistent data.

Working with the team has felt like a bit of a challenge at times. A colleague made some (I felt) insensitive remarks about my work from the previous sprint. There was also a push from some team mates to change work that I and another team mate did during the last sprint, where I tried to talk to them about some compromises but it felt like they didn't want to engage and meet me halfway. It sort of dampened my mood this week and made me reluctant to communicate as much as previously, and I have worked more by myself this week as a result. Last week I wrote that I wanted to grow as a team mate but I felt like I had to take a step back this week.

I feel good about the work that I do, that it is interesting, and that I am learning a lot. 
But I feel a bit frustrated about working remote, and never meeting in person, and feel that it is making it harder to communicate and work together, especially as we don't know each other. Ideally working together would also just be more fun and pleasant, and there would be more effort to appreciate one another and each others' work.
